# BoomBikes Demand Model
> The assignment aims to model the demand for shared bikes with the available dataset. This model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features, which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands.

## General Information
- BoomBikes Demand's model is an individual assignment done to draw insights like which features are most significant in determining the demands for shared bikes. 
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
- Business problem:
  i. The company wants to understand which factors are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  ii. And how well those variables describe the bike demands
- The dataset we have used here is "day.csv"

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature is very significant in determining the demand for the bikes.
- Windspeed is another significant factor.
- Year by year the demand for these bikes is rising.
- Winter season and Rainy weather also counts for the demands for these bikes.
